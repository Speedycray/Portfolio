In this project, I hosted an exploit through a webserver with python3, Set up an LDAP listener to point to that server/exploit, and exploited Log4J's JNDI feature within Apache Solr to obtain a reverse powershell from the victim.
### **Reources:**
*  [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/solar)
*  [Installing Apache Solr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km81Zsd7Dx8)
*  [John Hammond Log4J video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qoPDq41xhQ&t=967s)

### **Skills:** 
*  Set up attacker (Kali) and (Windows) victim virtual machines
*  Installed older version of Java
*  Obfuscated and utilized reverse powershell one-liner
*  Installed Java builder Maven
*  Set up Netcat listener for reverse shell session

### **Results:**
*  Able to open any application through victim's command prompt
*  Opened reverse powershell in attacker machine
*  Implemented [Threatlocker](https://www.threatlocker.com/) security software to stop the reverse shell

In this project, I used the WiFi Pineapple for wireless pentesting.
### **Resources:**
* [WiFi Pineapple Documentation](https://docs.hak5.org/wifi-pineapple/)

### **Skills:**
* Set up a WiFi Pineapple
* Learned about deauthentication and dissassociation
* Learned about associating a client using PineAP

### **Result:**
* Kicked off everyone from the network and reassociated them to the WiFi Pineapple to be able to capture credentials in the captive portal.
